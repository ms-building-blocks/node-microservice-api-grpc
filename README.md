# node-microservice-restify-grpc

We were in search of a boilerplate for microservice development and could not find one.  So we are make an attempt at creating one.   

The initial requirements were:
* Node.js based
* Initial rest based API for external access (if needed)
* gRPC for inter services communications.
* GraphQL for API enhancements.   (Planned)

## Getting Started

yarn or npm install.

### Prerequisites

This is being designed and meant for kubernetes clusters.   We will be adding detailed documentation for running on docker and kubernetes.
